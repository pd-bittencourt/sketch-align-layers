# Align Layers
Quick fix from the plugin Matt D. Smith's made from a remapped Dan Eden's "Align Layers" shortcuts in Sketch. This version uses `^` and `⌘` + the arrow keys to quickly align objects and removes the need to use the `shift` key. Full commands below:

- `^ ⌘ ←` align left
- `^ ⌘ →` align right
- `^ ⌘ ↑` align top
- `^ ⌘ ↓` align bottom
- `^ ⌘ .` align vertical (center)
- `^ ⌘ /` align horizontal (middle)

Matt made a [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk5pYsy4OEE) that explains its usefulness and such...

## Installation
1. [Download the plugin repository](https://github.com/mds/sketch-shortcuts/archive/master.zip)
2. Double-click the `.sketchplugin` file
3. In Sketch, run the plugin with one of the shortcuts.

Once I learn more about creating Sketch Plugins, I'll update this plugin to include even more useful quick keys...

_Mad props to [Dan Eden](http://twitter.com/_dte) for the original plugin._
